# DeepQwaft

This project is a clone of Dave Churchill's Sparcraft with the addition of one extra bot, DeepQ. 
As the name suggests, this bot utilizes deep q learning to learn how to play. I am in the process
of training one scenario, and once it is done, then I will upload the .caffemodel for all to enjoy.
Down the line, I would like to have one model capable of doing matches X units vs Y units for any 
unit type.
