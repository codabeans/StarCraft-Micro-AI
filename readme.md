# StarCraft Micro AI

This project is a clone of Dave Churchill's Sparcraft with the addition of one extra bot, DeepQ. WHen I started this project, I simply wanted to see if generic Deep Q learning would suffice in learning how to play SparCraft. As I expected, it did not. It failed to converge on any level. 

Moving forward, this bot will utilize policy gradients and hopefully have better success.
